# Sprint1 Goal

1. Fix all the exiting bugs for philip's a1 code.
2. Finish implete the six design pattern.
3. Merger all six design pattern to the develop branch.
4. Finish at least three stories.
5. Start working on online mode and figure out how to implete it.

# Stories

1. We currently have 10 stories. 8 of them are the features we want to add to the game and 2 of them are the bugs we currently observed in the Philip's a1 starter code.
2. We decide to add story 1.11 which is online game feature that allows two human player play the game over the internet. This feature allow the player to match more people and play with them. We also decide to add invite friends feature which will send a tweet on twitter to invite friends to play this game.
3. We add 6 new stories for 6 different design pattern for impletement the pattern and commit.

# Assessment

In the sprint1, we decide to first to fix the existing bugs that we found in Philip's code, after that we'll finished the all six design patterns that we already been talk about in sprint0, merge them to one branch after testing. Then we'll create 8 feature branches base on this branch to start implement 8 story features and finish at least 3 of them.

# Process

**Philip:** Fix the bug in `canMoveOnTo()` function. Implement the iterator pattern. Also implement the "step timer" feature and the "Human VS GreedyAgent Rank" feature.

**Pengcheng:** Fix the greedyAgent's move bug. Implement the command and builder pattern, and implement the load board and randomly generated game boards feature.

**Zezhu:** Develope the online mode, implement the observer and factor patterns, and implement the human move score and possible move features.

**Hongsheng:** Completed the strategy pattern, Chat feature and cheat feature, also replaced the design patten pdf description.
