### Meeting Content
We had discussed on how to connect each pattern together and corroborate better.
We reviewed each other's codes, give advices and unified coding style.
Pengcheng and Zezhu had a debate on how to create board and we finally combine their method together.
Hidden bugs was found and fixed.

### Unfinished Tasks
Online mode is still under construction; Human score calculating is not working because greedyAgent bugs occur again.

### Practices Should be continued
We collaborate as a perfect team, any problems/issues are announced immediately in the group chat and one of our teammate
is taking responsibility for that issuse/problem. We should keep working as a team and keep the efficiency of our communication.

### More Practices for Next Sprint
More meeting should be held for bug fixing, presentation organize and PowePoint making.
One meeting is not enough when facing some unexpect problems.

### Practices Should be Stopped
Meeting should not be held on the last day. The last day is for double check for any issues instead of doing any works.

### Best/Worst Experience
During the meeting, we accidentally committed a change that delete all important files/works, we did researches to
find the best way to revert our work and finally all files are back.
This is our worst experience because everyone was nervous that this accident happened at the last day and all of us were
thinking we have to redo all works in one day, but this is also the best experience because all our files are back and we
learn that we have to calm down when facing problems, and we can always find a solution when being cool. (We once had 
120+ commits on develop branch to find our works back lol)
